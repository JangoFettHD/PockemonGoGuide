    <h2 class="text-center">What is the Gym and How to join Gym and battle other players?</h2>

    <p>When you reach level five and visit a Gym, you'll be asked to join one of three color-coded teams: Instinct
        (Yellow), Mystic (Blue), or Valor (Red). They're color-coded based on the original U.S. titles – Pokémon Red,
        Pokémon Blue, and Pokémon Yellow: Special Pikachu Edition.</p>
    <p>Unlike Nintendo's games, the team you choose doesn't affect the type of Pokémon you come across in the wild, but
        it does matter for Gym battles. After picking a team, you'll join millions of other players around the world;
        each team will work together to become the most successful. As with Niantic's previous title, Ingress, teams can
        turn Pokémon Go from a single-player experience to a group sport.</p>
    <p>Teams are how you join up with your friends to make a dent on the world. You and your team will take over and
        level up Gyms; when you possess a gym, you get Pokécoins and Stardust, which can help you level up and evolve
        your Pokémon.</p>

    <p>Much like PokéStops, Gyms are actual landmarks out in the world, and they are where all Pokémon battles happen.
        You can claim them for your team, or help level up a Gym already claimed for your team to build up its prestige.
        Trainers can take over an unoccupied Gym and claim it for the Instinct, Mystic, or Valor team. If your team's
        color is in control of a Gym, you can train your Pokémon inside, one at a time. If a Gym is held by an opposing
        team, you'll need to battle the Pokémon standing guard to lower its prestige and have a chance of taking it
        over.</p>
    <p>Gyms earn prestige when you train your Pokémon in one that your team controls, and lose prestige when opposing
        teams win battles against the Pokémon left there. Your team's Gym will earn experience points to gain prestige,
        which will amount to leveling up the Gym. As its levels increase, so do the number of Gym Leaders. For example,
        if your Gym has reached level three, you can have three Gym Leaders in it, which makes it harder for opposing
        teams to overthrow.</p>
    <p>Entering a Gym triggers a fun mini-game wherein you attack the opposing Pokémon, and dodge their attacks. While
        battling, you have three options: You can tap the screen to attack, press and hold the screen to initiate a
        special attack, or swipe left or right to dodge an opponent's attack. Just as with traditional Pokémon games,
        the goal is to reduce your opponent's Pokémon to zero hit points.</p>
    <p>To steal control of a Gym that is already occupied by an opposing team, you must win in battle against all of the
        Gym Leaders' Pokémon in it. Beating leaders in the Gym will lower its prestige, but it will take multiple
        battles against the same Pokémon in order to occupy it for your team.</p>
    <p>When you occupy a gym, you not only help your team — but you earn PokéCoins, too! Every 20 hours, you can visit
        the Shop and redeem your coins, based on how many gyms you currently occupy.</p>
