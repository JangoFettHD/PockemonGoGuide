    <h2>How to play Pokémon Go?</h2>

    <p>Most people have at least heard of Pokémon — Nintendo's ever-popular title — which asks players to travel a
        fictional world in order to collect every creature out there. But today's world is not the world of the 1990s:
        Nintendo and Niantic Labs have teamed up to let players catch Pokémon in the very world we live in, thanks to a
        combination of GPS, augmented reality, and dorky-cute graphics.</p>
    <p>Pokémon Go retains the basics of Pokémon games past — catching Pokémon, battling at Gyms, using items, evolving
        your creatures — with a crazy twist: You're doing it all in the real world. That means instead of tapping or
        using a D-pad to tell your virtual avatar where to go to find Pokémon, you're actually walking. In the real
        world. Crazy, we know.</p>
    <p>You may have stumbled onto this page knowing nothing about Pokémon. That's okay. You don't have to be a fan of
        the previous games or even know the lore to have fun with this game: While it may overtly promote itself as a
        game about catching Pokémon and battling, the real joy is exploring the real world with your friends, giggling
        while you check in at historical monuments disguised as PokéStops, and making new connections in your
        neighborhood with other would-be Pokétrainers.</p>
