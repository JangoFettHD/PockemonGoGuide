    <h2>Pokémon Go - server status, error messages, crashes and how to know the game is down</h2>
    <h3>Pokémon Go server status - how do I know if the server has gone down?</h3>

    <p class="small">Seeing this when logging in is usually a sign the servers are down right now.</p>
    <p>You can usually tell servers are offline with an explicit message along the lines of 'we are working to resolve
        the issue', alongside a specific piece of cute Pokémon Go art work.</p>
    <p>If you see this, chances are you'll have to return in a little while to play.</p>
    <p>If you want to be sure that the servers are currently down, there's also a few days of knowing outside of the
        game too; the game's official Twitter account will report on any significant outages, while a fan-run Pokémon Go
        server status website uses crowdsourced feedback to determine whether the server is experiencing major
        issues.</p>
    <h3>Pokémon Go error messages and unstable servers</h3>
    <p>There are also other error messages that you might see. When logging in, you might be told you have 'Failed to
        get game data from the server' or 'Failed to log in'. This likely means that while the server isn't down
        completely, it is currently busy, so tap the Retry button and give it another go.</p>

         alt="" class="img-responsive">
    <p class="small">If you see this, then the server might still be up - just busy.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile, mid-game a red band can appear at the top of the screen with a message such as 'GPS signal not found',
        'Internet connection not found' and 'Error'. These suggest the issue is client side - so your phone is causing a
        possible issue - and so it's worth checking the strength of your phone's connection and moving location to see
        if that resolves the issue. Servers might also have some impact in these cases too, and waiting a moment usually
        helps clear these issues up.</p>
    <p>It's also worth noting that though connecting to Wi-Fi can provide a stronger signal when playing, if you are
        walking past shops, pubs and other places you have access to, the constant logging in and out of different
        hotspots may cause some confusion for the app, so it could be worth relying on phone data only if you are on the
        move.</p>
    <h3>What to do when Pokémon Go crashes when catching Pokémon</h3>
    <p>A common issue is the app will freeze when you throw a Pokéball at creature. In the period when the creature
        entering the ball for the first time, the ball shaking and before the 'Gotcha' message appears, the app can stop
        responding, even enough the loading icon will rotate in the corner and some on-screen graphics will continue to
        move.</p>

         alt="" class="img-responsive">
    <p class="small">Check your journal after the app crashes to see if you caught the creature after all.</p>
    <p>First, wait a few seconds to see if the app will respond. If it doesn't progress to the 'Gotcha!' phrase, then
        the app has likely frozen.</p>
    <p>However, not all is lost. If you quit the game and reload it (make sure it's properly closed, and not just
        minimised) then check your journal (tap the Trainer icon in the lower level corner, then the Journal button
        underneath the XP bar) you'll see a list of recent activities, from PokéStop interactions to Pokémon captured.
        Here you'll be able to see whether the creature you just captured is indeed yours or not; in our experience
        there's about a 50/50 chance it picks up on the capture after a crash, so it's worth a check to see if it made
        it through!</p>
