    <h2>Gotta Catch ‘Em All?</h2>

    <p>We’re hoping if you’re reading this guide, you’re already logged into your Pokemon Go app and ready to start capturing Pokemon. While you’re looking at the map of your surrounding area, you’ll notice a small, white rectangle that highlights what Pokemon are in your immediate area. Tap on that area to bring up the “Nearby” window. This window will display all of the Pokemon close by as well as their distance to you. Distance is measured in paw prints. The smaller the number of prints, the closer the Pokemon is to you. Unfortunately, no one knows the exactdistance Pokemon are located based on paw prints, but just know the fewer the prints, the closer it is to you.</p>

    <p>The next thing to do is select a Target Pokemon. Once selected, you’ll need to keep an eye on the amount of paw prints that’s displayed as this is how you’ll be able to track where the Pokemon is located. You can also use Incense and Lures to increase the amount of Pokemon spawning around you.</p>
    <p>Now - start walking.</p>
    <p>While you’re walking, if the number of paw prints goes up, turn around and walk the other way so the number goes back down. Continue walking in the direction where the paw prints are going down, and they’ll eventually go back up again. Turn around again and go to the point where the amount of paw prints is the lowest, then turn 90 degrees to either side and walk directly forward. If you’re walking away from your target, turn around to walk straight towards your Pokemon.</p>
    <p>If our directions are tough to visualize, here’s a handy infographic that was submitted to Reddit which makes a little more sense of everything:</p>
