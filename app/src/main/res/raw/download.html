    <h3>How to download Pokémon Go for Android</h3>
    <p>If you want to play Pokémon Go on your Android device, and you're not in a country that has made Pokémon Go
        available through the Google Play store, then the following instructions will show you how to download it from a
        third-party website.</p>

    <h4>Download the Pokémon Go APK file</h4>
    <p>First you need to allow your Android device to install and run apps downloaded from other places. Be cautious
        when you turn on this setting, as you'll want to make sure you only download apps you know are safe and
        reliable.</p>

         alt="" class="img-responsive center-block">
    <p>Open up Settings and go to Security. Scroll down and next to where it says 'Unknown sources', tap the toggle to
        turn this setting on.</p>
    <p>Now you need to download the Pokémon Go APK file. On your Android device go to the
        <a href="http://www.apkmirror.com/apk/niantic-inc/pokemon-go/pokemon-go-0-29-2-release/pokemon-go-0-29-2-android-apk-download/">
            <button class="btn btn-xs">Pokémon Go APK webpage</button>
        </a>
        and tap
        on 'Download APK'. Select 'OK' when the warning message appears and Pokémon Go will download. This APK file is
        now the latest version of Pokémon Go.</p>

    <p>Once it's downloaded, swipe your finger down from the top of your Android device to see the notification area and
        select the Pokémon Go file, then select 'Install'. Pokémon Go will now install, letting you play right now.
        Happy hunting!</p>

    <h3>How to download and install Pokémon Go on iPhone</h3>
    <p>If you have an iPhone or another iOS device, then the process for getting Pokémon Go is slightly different.</p>
    <p>While Pokémon Go is
        <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/nz/app/pokemon-go/id1094591345?mt=8">
            <button class="btn btn-xs">available on the App Store</button>
        </a>
        , if it's not available in your country follow our instructions on
        how to download and install it.</p>

    <h4>Log out of your Apple ID</h4>
    <p>First of all, you'll need to make your iPhone belive you're in a region that can download Pokémon Go. Open up
        Settings on your iPhone, tap on 'Apple ID' and select to sign out.</p>
    <p>Now go back into Settings and select General > Language & Region. Set your region as US, New Zealand or Australia
        - all of these regions can download Pokémon Go.</p>

         alt="" class="img-responsive center-block">

    <h4>Open up the App Store</h4>
    <p>Now open up the App Store. Search for Pokémon Go and it should appear. If it doesn't choose a free app to
        download and select 'Create new Apple ID'.</p>
    <p>Go through the
        <a href="http://www.techradar.com/how-to/phone-and-communications/mobile-phones/how-to-create-an-apple-id-1313078">
            <button class="btn btn-xs">process of creating an Apple ID</button>
        </a>
         and select 'None' in the Billing menu and add a US, New Zealand or
        Australian address. Google can come in handy here if you need to search for an address.</p>

    <h4>Download Pokémon Go onto your iPhone</h4>
    <p>Now you can download and install Pokémon Go onto your iPhone or iPad. Once Pokémon Go is released in your region
        you can sign back in with your Apple ID - though you may need to reinstall Pokémon Go.</p>
    <p>Luckily your data is saved to the cloud, so you'll be able to play Pokémon Go where you left off.</p>
