    <h2>What is the Poké Bal and how to catch Pokémon?</h2>

    <p>Once you've gotten started with the game and captured your first Pokémon, it's time to go hunting for some
        others.
    <p>You can find wild Pokémon by physically walking around your area. Stick to populated areas: Pokémon appear most
        often near PokéStops. The more PokéStops nearby, the more creatures should appear. Try visiting locations with a
        lot of public art; tourist spots or malls are great starting points.</p>
    <p>As you walk around in the real world, your avatar moves along the map using GPS. When a Pokémon is close enough
        to capture, it pops up on your screen. Since walking around with your eyes glued to your phone is a bit of a
        safety hazard, the game is designed to allow you to keep your eyes free while you wander. You can keep your
        phone at your side while you walk; when you are near a Pokémon, you'll get a notification in the form of a
        vibration and (if your sound is turned on) the Pokémon's unique call.</p>
    <p>You can then move to a safe location (if you were walking along a road, for instance), and tap the visible
        Pokémon to capture it. Tapping zooms in on your avatar and launches an augmented reality experience with the
        Pokémon dancing around amidst your surroundings. If you don't see it on the screen immediately in front of you,
        move your device around until it appears. (There are arrows on the side of the screen to guide you in the right
        direction.)</p>
    <p>If AR makes you nauseous or you don't want your battery drained, you can always turn the feature off in the upper
        right corner.</p>
    <p>Once you've found the Pokémon, it's time to throw a Poké Ball to try and capture it. You "throw" in game by
        tapping and holding on your Poké Ball; a glowing, shrinking ring appears then around the Pokémon. When the ring
        gets to its smallest, you want to flick your Poké Ball directly toward the creature (with the aim of bopping it
        on the head) and release your finger; if successful, you'll capture the Pokémon inside.</p>
    <p>Not all Pokémon enjoy being inside itty bitty areas, however, and some may jump out of your Poké Ball after one
        or two shakes. If this happens, you'll want to throw another Poké Ball to try and recapture it — or, if you're
        running low on supplies, run away.</p>
    <p>As you progress in the game, you'll encounter stronger Pokémon that require a more powerful Poké Ball (or Razz
        Berries, which lull the Pokémon to complacency). If the ring surrounding the Pokémon is green, you should have
        no problem capturing it; if it's yellow, you have a fifty-fifty chance; when you see a red ring, you'll need to
        use multiple Poké Balls, more powerful Poké Balls, or Razz Berries to have a remote chance of catching it.</p>
    <p>More than one player can catch the same Pokémon; if you and your friend see the same Pokémon on the street, you
        can both grab it for your separate collections.</p>
    <p>You can also use special items to attract Pokémon to your location: You can use incense to lure Pokémon to you
        personally for 30 minutes, or — if you're at a PokéStop — use a Lure Patch. This will bring Pokémon to the stop;
        every player there can catch them for the next 15 minutes.</p>
