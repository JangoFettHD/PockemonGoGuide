    <h2>22 Helpful Pokémon Go Tips You Might Not Know Yet</h2>

    <h3>1. Each pawprint on the Pokémon tracker represents about a 100-meter distance.</h3>
    <img src="https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-07/12/15/asset/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane03/sub-buzz-11670-1468352548-26.png?resize=625:1011&no-auto"
         alt="" class="img-responsive">
    <p>So at the most, you’ll only have to run about three football fields if you see the silhouette of that Dragonite you’ve been looking for.</p>
    <h3>2. Your eggs won’t gain hatching progress if you travel faster than 15 mph.</h3>
    <img src="https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-07/12/15/asset/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane03/sub-buzz-11663-1468352920-2.jpg?resize=625:352&no-auto"
         alt="" class="img-responsive">
    <p>Some claim it’s 12 mph. Either way, you’re probably not going to make any progress if you’re driving.</p>
    <h3>3. Speaking of eggs, these are (generally) the Pokémon that hatch from the different egg types.</h3>
    <img src="https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-07/12/13/asset/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane03/sub-buzz-29404-1468345182-8.jpg?resize=625:424&no-auto"
         alt="" class="img-responsive">
    <p></p>There’s an easier-to-read version of this list here. However, this list isn’t 100% accurate, and you might find Pokémon in a 2 km egg that’s listed here for 5 km eggs, for example.</h3>
    <h3>4. That curve on your Pokémon’s profile indicates its potential and should factor heavily into your decision to evolve or not.</h3>
    <img src="https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-07/12/15/asset/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane01/sub-buzz-19402-1468353101-1.jpg?resize=625:1109&no-auto"
         alt="" class="img-responsive">
    <p>How much space is left on the curve is dependent upon your trainer level. If you have two Pokémon of similar CP and one has more progress left, that might end up being a stronger Pokémon.</p>
    <h3>5. There is a way to get Pikachu as your starter Pokémon.</h3>
    <img src="https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-07/12/16/asset/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane01/sub-buzz-19275-1468353667-2.jpg?resize=625:352&no-auto"
         alt="" class="img-responsive">
    <p>If you continually run away from your first battle with the starter Pokémon you choose, eventually Pikachu should show up as a starter option.</p>
    <h3>6. The app uses a combination of your step count and GPS location to hatch eggs, so the stuff in this rather silly video won’t work.</h3>
    <p>People are trying to attach their phones to bicycle wheels, Roombas, and their dogs in order to hatch eggs. But unless you actually move around enough for the GPS to register it, you won’t see any progress. Maybe tie it to your dog’s collar and set them out in the yard?</p>
    <h3>7. Turning off AR (which can be done when you encounter a Pokémon) will save battery life.</h3>
    <img src="https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-07/12/16/asset/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane03/sub-buzz-12974-1468354999-1.jpg?resize=625:541&no-auto"
         alt="" class="img-responsive">
    <p>It won’t make a huge difference, but it will use slightly less battery power, which could add up over time.</p>
    <h3>8. You can also download Google Maps offline for your area to save a bit on data and battery.</h3>
    <img src="https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-07/12/16/asset/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane02/sub-buzz-14741-1468355186-9.jpg?resize=625:407&no-auto"
         alt="" class="img-responsive">
    <p>Some users report that downloading local map data will help conserve a bit of battery and cut down on data use. It’s a good idea in theory, but one of Google’s engineerssays it won’t actually help you. Still, it won’t hurt to try if you have the extra storage space.</p>
    <h3>9. You can train with the Pokémon at your own gym for extra XP and Gym Prestige.</h3>
    <img src="https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-07/12/16/asset/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane02/sub-buzz-19780-1468355358-1.png?resize=625:370&no-auto"
         alt="" class="img-responsive">
    <p>If you already have a spot at a gym, you can train instead of battling the other Pokémon there. When you do, you’ll use only one of your Pokémon, and your Pokémon won’t faint (but it will lose HP). You’ll get a little bit, but not a ton, of XP and Gym Prestige at the end.</p>
    <h3>10. There’s a new update out today that helps fix some of the annoying bugs present at launch.</h3>
    <img src="https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-07/12/14/asset/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane02/sub-buzz-31975-1468347577-1.jpg?resize=625:757&no-auto"
         alt="" class="img-responsive">
    <p>The fixes include not having to log in again every time you quit the app (thank goodness) and correcting the data that the app has access to in your Google account (much less than before).</p>
    <h3>11. Stock up on Lucky Eggs and use them right before you’re about to hatch a lot of eggs or evolve a lot of your Pokémon.</h3>
    <img src="https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-07/12/16/asset/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane02/sub-buzz-19783-1468355577-1.jpg?no-auto"
         alt="" class="img-responsive">
    <p>If you want to level up fast, make sure you have at least one Lucky Egg. Then, get a bunch of candy and incubate some eggs until they’re just about to hatch. When you pop the Lucky Egg, you’ll get double XP for 30 minutes, so each Pokémon you evolve will get you 1,000 XP instead of 500. Additionally, if you hatch those eggs and get new Pokémon out of them, you’ll again get 1,000 XP each.</p>
    <h3>12. The cheapest and easiest Pokémon to evolve are Weedle, Pidgey, Caterpie, and Rattata.</h3>
    <img src="https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-07/12/16/asset/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane02/sub-buzz-19787-1468355763-1.jpg?resize=625:375&no-auto"
         alt="" class="img-responsive">
    <p>Each of them only needs 12 candy of their type to evolve, so it’s good to stock up on them for XP purposes. If you have a Lucky Egg, you can potentially evolve a bunch of them at once for massive XP gains.</p>
    <h3>13. Eevee evolutions are completely random.</h3>
    <img src="https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-07/12/16/asset/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane01/sub-buzz-24973-1468355893-2.jpg?resize=625:352&no-auto"
         alt="" class="img-responsive">
    <p>No matter what your Eevee’s starting moves are, the “Eeveelution” that they end up with seems to be totally random. Just keep your fingers crossed for that Vaporeon you’re hoping for.</p>
    <h3>14. Gyms can be one of the best sources of XP if you run away a lot.</h3>
    <img src="https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-07/12/16/asset/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane02/sub-buzz-21683-1468356232-2.jpg?resize=625:555&no-auto"
         alt="" class="img-responsive">
    <p>Go into a gym battle, defeat the first opponent, then run. You’ll still get XP from the encounter, and you should be able to hop back in and do that indefinitely for a decent amount of XP per hour.</p>
    <h3>15. Consider renaming your most-used Pokémon with their types and/or abilities so you know which ones to pick in your gym battles.</h3>
    <img src="https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-07/12/14/asset/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane03/sub-buzz-30668-1468347889-9.png?resize=625:1111&no-auto"
         alt="" class="img-responsive">
    <p>Since battles are real-time, it’s tough to grab the right Pokémon for the matchup quickly. Naming your Pokémon in this way will help you make a snap decision. Sure, it’s not as fun as the hilarious meme-based names you used before, but are you trying to be the very best or not?</p>
    <h3>16. You’ll need to travel outside your area in order to complete your Pokédex.</h3>
    <img src="https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-07/12/16/asset/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane01/sub-buzz-26651-1468356516-1.jpg?resize=625:352&no-auto"
         alt="" class="img-responsive">
    <p>The Pokémon in your area are different from the Pokémon in other neighborhoods. You might need to go to a different town, state, or even country, depending on how close the border is, to actually catch ‘em all.</p>
    <h3>17. Factors like the weather and time of day will affect what types of Pokémon you encounter.</h3>
    <img src="https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-07/12/19/enhanced/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane03/grid-cell-23092-1468365538-20.jpg"
         alt="" class="img-responsive">
    <p>Dark and ghost Pokémon reportedly come out more often at night, and water-type Pokémon are more likely to show up in your area if it’s raining. So Southern Californians might have trouble getting any water-types.</p>
    <h3>18. You can collect your gym rewards once every 21 hours.</h3>
    <img src="https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-07/12/17/asset/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane02/sub-buzz-22297-1468357280-1.jpg?resize=625:889&no-auto"
         alt="" class="img-responsive">
    <p>Once you have a Pokémon guarding a gym, check the shield icon in the top-right corner of the Shop for Defense Bonuses. As long as you’re stationed at that gym without being defeated, you’ll get coins every 21 hours that you can spend on items.</p>
    <h3>19. PokéStops refresh about once every five minutes!</h3>
    <img src="https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-07/12/17/asset/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane01/sub-buzz-27319-1468357470-2.jpg?resize=625:337&no-auto"
         alt="" class="img-responsive">
    <p>When the color turns back from purple to blue, you’re good to go collect more items…and that happens a lot faster than you’d think.</p>
    <h3>20. Avoid evolving a three-tier-evolution Pokémon unless you can do both evolutions right away.</h3>
    <img src="https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-07/12/19/enhanced/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane02/grid-cell-25315-1468365732-9.jpg" alt="" class="img-responsive">
    <img src="https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-07/12/19/enhanced/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane02/grid-cell-25315-1468365733-14.jpg"
         alt="" class="img-responsive">
    <p>Let’s say you have a Ghastly, and you evolve it right away into Haunter, but that leaves you with zero Ghastly candy. By the time you earn enough Ghastly candy to evolve your Haunter into a Gengar, chances are you’ll be a much higher level and will already be catching higher-CP Ghastly and Haunter that will be much better candidates for evolution.</p>
    <h3>21. If the game freezes while you’re capturing a Pokémon and you have to quit out, just check your Journal when you log back in.</h3>
    <img src="https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-07/12/17/asset/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane02/sub-buzz-22261-1468357659-1.jpg?resize=625:1109&no-auto"
         alt="" class="img-responsive">
    <p>Your Journal keeps a log of all your encounters, so it’ll tell you if that Pokémon was caught or ran away while you were cursing and restarting the app.</p>
    <h3>22. And finally, here are the level-up rewards for levels 1–20, in case you’re curious:</h3>
    <img src="https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-07/12/14/asset/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane01/sub-buzz-4633-1468346606-3.png?resize=625:577&no-auto"
         alt="" class="img-responsive">
    <p>You get Razz Berries at level 8, Great Balls at level 12, and Ultra Balls at level 20.</p>
